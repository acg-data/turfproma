                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Early Spring (March) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Service your mower and sharpen the blade. Clear away winter debris like leaves, branches, and matted grass so sunlight reaches and warms the soil faster. Light raking removes thatch, prevents matted grass from dying off, and helps lawns recover from snow mold.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    This is also an appropriate time to apply crabgrass pre-emergent, such as Prodiamine. You can also apply dithiopyr; although we recommend a second application several weeks later because it leaches more easily through the soil. A second application of dithiopyr can prolong the product's window of effectiveness and provide some control over crabgrass that's beginning to emerge. Both Prodiamine and dithiopyr are generally considered safe for children and pets once they have dried completely after application, but always check the product label for specific instructions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    For an eco-friendlier approach, corn gluten meal is often marketed as natural pre-emergent weed control, but there is ongoing debate about how it actually works. Some believe it suppresses weeds by inhibiting root development at germination, while others argue that its main benefit comes from the nitrogen it provides, which helps turf grow thicker and outcompete weeds.
                </p>

                <!-- Mid-Spring Tasks -->
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Mid-Spring (April) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    April brings active lawn growth. Apply fertilizer and your first crabgrass pre-emergent if you haven't yet—Prodiamine in mid-March to very early April, otherwise use dithiopyr, which offers a broader application window and some post-emergent control up to the first tiller stage (5 leaves). Spot-treat weeds as they appear.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Begin mowing, setting the blade high at 3-3.5 inches. Cut only one-third of the grass blade at a time. Mowing more than one-third off at once will cause growth to slow as it puts more resources into the leaf blade to help it recover.
                </p>

                <!-- Late Spring Tasks -->
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Late Spring (May) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Mow weekly, sharpen your mower's blade, and alternate mowing patterns to prevent soil compaction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    As the weather warms up, monitor how much water your lawn naturally receives via rain, and turn on irrigation. Water in the early morning, deeply and infrequently, which means less frequent but more thorough sessions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Watch for signs of pests or disease. Chinch bugs and fungal issues can emerge in late spring; however, it's likely easier to notice activity in early summer when they're a bit more mature. Catching problems early makes them much easier to manage.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Assessing Winter Damage</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Winter is tough on lawns. Start by walking your lawn and looking for signs of stress. Check for compacted soil and matted grass.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Any small bare patches are common and require attention. If you're unsure what might have happened to your lawn, the University of Massachusetts lawn diagnostic guide can help. For example, if your lawn is brown, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong with it. It might just be a cool-season grass that thrives in mid-spring but goes dormant in very high and low temperatures.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Looking at blade texture can offer clues about your grass type. Fine, soft blades are often associated with fine fescues and perennial ryegrass, while wider, tougher blades are more common in tall fescue and some bluegrass varieties. Also, observe the growth pattern: dense, upright growth suggests a cool-season grass, whereas a spreading or horizontal pattern typically indicates a warm-season grass.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Identifying Your Grass Type</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Are you caring for cool season grasses like Kentucky Bluegrass, Fescue, or Ryegrass? Or warm-season varieties like Bermudagrass, Zoysia, or St. Augustine?
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The difference is huge. Cool-season grasses grow in spring and fall. Warm-season grasses grow when it's warmer. Your grass type affects feeding, mowing, and watering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Regional Considerations Across the US</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Where you live affects how your grass grows. Local weather affects how you treat your lawn. What works in Atlanta might not work in Detroit. The US is divided into three turf zones:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Northern Zone:</strong> Cool-season grasses (Michigan, New York, Minnesota, Massachusetts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Southern Zone:</strong> Warm-season grasses (Georgia, Texas, Florida)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition Zone:</strong> Both cool and warm-season grasses (Missouri, Virginia, Kansas)</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Early Spring Lawn Preparation -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Early Spring Lawn Preparation</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The following steps are among the most important lawn maintenance tips. This advice can help prevent problems before they start and promote vigorous, healthy growth.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Clearing Winter Debris</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Your first task is to thoroughly clean up your yard. Winter leaves behind branches, matted leaves, and clutter that block sunlight and may harbor mold or pests. We recommend using a sturdy leaf rake or blower. Remove everything from the surface. Don't just focus on the obvious piles. Check along fences, under trees, and in corners where debris collects.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Raking and Dethatching</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Next, vigorously rake your lawn. This does more than just clean it. It helps dethatch the lawn by pulling up dead grass stems and roots (thatch) at the soil level. Some thatch helps retain water, but too much thatch blocks vital nutrients and water from reaching the roots. Use a spring-tine rake until you see more green grass than brown. Dethatcher tines for ride-on mowers are also available.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Testing Soil pH and Composition</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    One of the smartest investments you can make is a simple soil test. It tells you exactly what's happening beneath the surface. You'll learn your soil's pH level and which nutrients are deficient. Most grasses thrive in slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0 to 7.0), which is typically the case in most Northeast lawns. If your pH is off, nutrients become "locked" in the soil and unavailable to your grass, no matter how much you fertilize.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Addressing Common Lawn Problems</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Even with the best care, lawns can emerge from winter looking thin, patchy, or stressed. Cold temperatures, snow and ice cover, desiccation, and frozen soil all take a toll on turf, making early-spring problems like weeds, bare spots, and poor color common. The key is understanding what your lawn is telling you and taking the right steps early, before small issues turn into season-long problems.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Dealing with Bare Patches</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Bare spots are common after winter, especially in areas affected by snow mold, foot traffic, plow damage, shade, or general thinning. As the lawn starts growing again in spring, these weak areas often become much more noticeable.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Small bare or thin spots can sometimes fill back in on their own as the surrounding grass spreads with proper mowing, fertilization, and watering.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    For larger bare spots or areas that are very bare, overseeding is the best approach. Lightly rake the soil to loosen the surface, spread a grass seed that matches your existing turf, and gently press it into the soil so it makes good seed-to-soil contact. Keep the area consistently moist for 10–14 days while the seed establishes. Aerating first and then overseeding is another option. For widespread thinning or full-lawn renovations, late summer through early fall is the ideal window.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Managing Lawn Diseases</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Fungal diseases can pop up as temperatures rise and conditions get wetter. Snow mold and brown patch are common. Catching them early stops them from spreading.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                    <li>Make sure there's good airflow by trimming trees and foliage</li>
                    <li>Water in the early morning so the grass dries by mid-morning</li>
                    <li>Avoid applying too much nitrogen in early spring, as it can exacerbate disease conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Addressing these factors can alleviate many issues without resorting to fungicides. Healthy lawns do a better job of fighting off diseases than turf that's stressed.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Controlling Spring Pests</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    As the soil warms up, pests start to feed. It's important to know which pest you're dealing with before treating it. Two of the most common pests you'll deal with in the Northeast are grubs and chinch bugs. Others include army worms, which are more common in the southern United States.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Grub damage is one of the most common — and most misunderstood — lawn problems. Many homeowners apply the wrong product at the wrong time and see little or no improvement, even though they "treated" their lawn. That's because some products are designed to prevent grubs from ever hatching, while others are meant to kill grubs that are already feeding.

                    Keep in mind that once grubs have reached their full size, usually by mid-September, curative treatments may only provide upwards of 50% population reduction. By spring, it may be less. Only spot-treat infested areas unless the entire lawn is infected. This is considered an "Integrated Pest Management" best practice. Overusing pesticides can cause future insect generations to develop resistance to the products, making them less effective.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Timing is critical. If you have Kentucky bluegrass or other cool-season grasses, plan to fertilize for the first time in March or April. For Bermuda and other warm-season varieties, it's best to wait until April to begin fertilizing.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    A second feeding 6-8 weeks later maintains momentum. For application, a broadcast spreader provides the easiest way to apply even coverage. Always calibrate your equipment and apply it on a calm day to prevent drift.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Organic fertilizers release nutrients gradually and feed soil biology over time, making them well suited for long-term soil improvement and steady turf growth. Synthetic fertilizers deliver nutrients in a more precise and immediately available form, which allows for faster green-up and tighter control over growth patterns.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Spring weeds compete with your lawn for nutrients, sunlight, and water. Here are three common culprits: Dandelions feature bright yellow flowers and long roots. Clover forms low, spreading mats across your yard. Crabgrass is often the most troublesome—it begins small but quickly overtakes your grass.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Timing is everything when using crabgrass pre-emergent herbicides. These products create a soil barrier that kills crabgrass right as it begins to emerge. Apply in early spring, when soil stays near 55°F for several days.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    You can also use the blooming of forsythia as your natural cue—'yellow blooms equal barrier time.' Applying too early can cause the herbicide to break down before weeds start growing, and applying too late can mean crabgrass seeds are already germinating.

                <!-- When to Start Mowing -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">When to Start Mowing Your Lawn in the Spring</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    When should you start mowing your lawn in the spring? Wait until the grass is actively growing and is about one-third taller than its ideal height. This usually happens when soil temperatures hit 50-55°F for cool-season grasses or 60-65°F for warm-season ones. Mowing too early can harm new growth. Waiting too long lets weeds grow and may force you to cut off more than one-third of the blade at once.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Ideal Grass Height for First Cut</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    For the first cut, aim for around 3 inches. Cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass and fescue do well at 3-4 inches year-round until the last cut. Warm-season grasses like Bermuda and Zoysia prefer 2-2.5 inches. On the last cut of the year, mow cool-season turf around 2-2.5 inches to prevent matting over the winter.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Never cut more than one-third of the grass blade at once. If your grass grew to 4 inches over winter, cut it down to around 2.75 inches first. This rule helps prevent shock and promotes thicker turf.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Maintain a consistent mowing schedule. In spring, that's probably every 5–7 days; as growth slows, that might be every 7–10 days. How often you mow will depend on how quickly your lawn grows. Regular mowing prevents stress and keeps your lawn thick and attractive.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Proper Mowing Techniques</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Keep your mower blades sharp. Dull blades tear grass, which can lead to disease. Sharpen blades at least once a season for clean cuts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Change your mowing pattern regularly to avoid compacting the soil and grass from leaning over. Mow only when turf is dry to ensure even cuts and prevent clumping.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    If you don't mind clippings, leave them on the lawn! Clippings add extra nitrogen to the soil and decompose quickly. This natural fertilization can cut your need for extra feeding by up to 25%.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Water is the lifeblood of your lawn. Getting your watering right is key to strong roots and healthy turf. It's the final step that brings all your springtime lawn maintenance efforts to life.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Setting Up Efficient Irrigation</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Consistency is everything. Whether you use an irrigation system or a simple hose-end sprinkler, you need to be sure your lawn is receiving even coverage. Check your sprinkler heads for clogs and misalignment in April or early May, or when conditions allow. A well-tuned system prevents dry spots and wasteful runoff, giving every part of your lawn the right amount of water.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Tailoring Watering for Different Lawn Areas</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Not every section of your lawn requires the same amount of water. Shady areas tend to retain moisture longer, so they often need less frequent watering or may not need to be watered at all. In contrast, spots that are in full sun or located on slopes typically dry out faster and benefit from receiving more water.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    To check if your sprinkler system is delivering enough water, scatter several containers around the yard, run your irrigation, and then measure how deep the water collects to see if you're reaching the goal of about one inch per week. This simple "water test" helps you adjust run times so your lawn gets the right amount of moisture without wasting water.

                    The goal of any lawn watering strategy should be deep, infrequent watering. This approach encourages roots to grow deeper into the soil in search of moisture, creating a more drought-tolerant and resilient lawn. Shallow, frequent watering does the opposite—it keeps roots near the surface and makes grass more vulnerable to heat and dry spells. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week, delivered in one or two sessions rather than daily light sprinkling.

                    <p class="text-brand-800">Deep, infrequent watering sessions are far better than shallow, daily ones. This encourages deeper root growth and creates a more drought-resistant lawn.</p>
