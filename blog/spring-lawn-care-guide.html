                <!-- Early Spring Tasks -->
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Early Spring (March) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    March is your setup month. Your lawn is waking up. First, service your lawnmower. Sharpen the blade and change the oil. A clean cut prevents disease from entering damaged, open areas in the turf.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Next, clear away winter debris from your lawn. Remove leaves, branches, and matted grass. This lets sunlight reach the soil and helps it warm up faster. A light raking removes thatch without damaging new growth. It will also prevent matted grass from dying and helps lawns recover from snow mold.
                </p>

                <!-- Mid-Spring Tasks -->
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Mid-Spring (April) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    April is when growth kicks into gear. Your lawn is actively greening up and needs fuel. Apply your first round of fertilizer now, if you have warm-season grass like Bermuda or Zoysia.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Weed prevention remains critical. If you didn't apply a pre-emergent in fall, consider a spring application to stop crabgrass. Spot-treat any early weeds that appear.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    You'll likely begin mowing this month. Set your mower blade high for the first cut—about 3 inches. This encourages deep root growth and shades out weeds. Never remove more than one-third of the grass blade at once.
                </p>

                <!-- Late Spring Tasks -->
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Late Spring (May) Tasks</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    By May, you're in full maintenance mode. Mowing becomes a regular weekly task. Keep your mower blade sharp. Alternate your mowing pattern each time to avoid soil compaction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    As temperatures rise, monitor your lawn's watering needs. Early morning is the best time to water. Aim for deep, infrequent watering.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Watch for signs of pests or disease. Chinch bugs and fungal issues can emerge in late spring. Catching problems early makes them much easier to manage.
                </p>

                <!-- Understanding Your Lawn's Spring Needs -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Your Lawn's Spring Needs</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Every lawn has a story after winter. Learning its needs is key to recovery. Before starting, know what your lawn needs. This knowledge guides all your decisions, from feeding to mowing.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Assessing Winter Damage</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Winter can be tough on your lawn. Start by walking your lawn and looking for signs of stress. Check for compacted soil and matted grass areas. Bare patches are common and need attention. They're opportunities to repair your lawn.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Identifying Your Grass Type</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Knowing your grass type is essential. Are you caring for cool-season grasses like Kentucky Bluegrass, Fescue, or Ryegrass? Or warm-season varieties like Bermudagrass, Zoysia, or St. Augustine?
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The difference is huge. Cool-season grasses grow in spring and fall. Warm-season grasses grow when it's warmer. Your grass type affects feeding, mowing, and watering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Regional Considerations Across the US</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Where you live affects your lawn. The US is divided into three lawn zones:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Northern Zone:</strong> Cool-season grasses (Michigan, New York, Minnesota, Massachusetts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Southern Zone:</strong> Warm-season grasses (Georgia, Texas, Florida)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition Zone:</strong> Both cool and warm-season grasses (Missouri, Virginia, Kansas)</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Early Spring Lawn Preparation -->
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Early Spring Lawn Preparation</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Early spring is like a reset button for your lawn. It's time to get rid of the old and prepare for the new. This foundational work is key for everything that comes next. It ensures your grass gets the sunlight, air, and nutrients it needs after winter.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Clearing Winter Debris</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Your first task is a thorough clean-up. Winter leaves behind a mess of branches, matted leaves, and general clutter. This debris blocks sunlight and can harbor mold or pests. We recommend using a sturdy leaf rake or a lawn broom. Remove everything from the surface. Don't just focus on the obvious piles—check along fences, under trees, and in corners where debris collects.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-brand-50 border border-brand-100 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-brand-900 mb-2">Expert Tip</h3>
                    <p class="text-brand-800">"A quick spring clean-up with a lawn rake to remove dead grass and debris is the perfect way to start the season."</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Raking and Dethatching</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Give your lawn a vigorous raking. This does more than just clean. It helps dethatch the lawn by pulling up dead grass stems and roots (thatch) at the soil level. A thin layer of thatch is normal. Too much acts like a barrier—it prevents water, fertilizer, and air from reaching the soil and roots. Use a spring-tine rake and rake thoroughly until you see more green than brown.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Testing Soil pH and Composition</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    One of the smartest investments you can make is a simple soil test. It tells you exactly what's happening beneath the surface. You'll learn your soil's pH level and which nutrients are deficient. Most grasses thrive in slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0 to 7.0).
                </p>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    When winter ends, your lawn might face issues that need quick fixes. Even with great care, lawns can struggle as they come back to life. Acting fast is key to keeping your lawn healthy and green all season.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Dealing with Bare Patches</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Bare spots often show up after winter. Spring's good weather is perfect for fixing them. For small spots, a patch repair product works great. For bigger areas, overseeding is best. Lightly rake the soil, apply grass seed that matches your lawn, and keep it moist until it grows.
                </p>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Fungal diseases can pop up as it gets warmer and wetter. Snow mold and brown patch are common. Catching them early stops them from spreading. Most diseases can be managed by improving lawn care:

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    As the soil warms up, pests start to move. Grubs and chinch bugs can harm your lawn. To control grubs, treat them when they're young and close to the surface. For insects, spot treatments are better than covering the whole lawn. Encourage good bugs and birds to help control pests naturally.

                    Spring feeding is more than just sprinkling granules; it's a strategic decision that sets your lawn's health for months. A proper spring fertilization plan replenishes nutrients lost over winter and encourages the deeper root growth your grass needs.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Application Timing and Methods</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Timing is critical. Apply too early and you mainly feed weeds. Apply too late and your lawn misses its peak growth window. For cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass, aim for March or April. For warm-season grasses like Bermuda, target April. A second feeding 6-8 weeks later maintains momentum.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Organic vs. Synthetic Options</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Both paths can lead to a green lawn, but they work differently. Synthetic fertilizers offer precise, fast-acting nutrients giving your lawn a quick "green-up." Organic options, like compost or milorganite, release nutrients slowly as they break down and improve soil structure over time. Many homeowners use a blend of both.

                    The best way to stop crabgrass is to prevent it before it grows. Pre-emergent herbicides create a soil barrier that stops weed seeds from growing. <strong>Timing is everything</strong>—apply when soil temperatures are 50-55°F for a few days. This is usually when forsythia blooms. Remember, pre-emergents won't kill existing weeds. For those, you need a post-emergent treatment.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Water is the lifeblood of your lawn. Getting your spring watering right is key to strong roots and healthy turf.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Watering Depth and Frequency</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The golden rule is <strong>water deeply but infrequently</strong>. Aim to moisten the soil down to 6-8 inches. This encourages roots to grow deep, making your lawn more drought-tolerant. For most lawns, one inch per week is perfect—split into one or two longer sessions. Always water in the early morning to reduce evaporation and prevent fungal diseases.
                </p>

                    <p class="text-brand-800">Place an empty tuna can on your lawn while watering. When it's full, you've applied about one inch of water—exactly what most lawns need per week!</p>

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Is your lawn thin or showing bare patches after winter? Spring overseeding is the perfect solution. It repairs damage and builds a thicker, more resilient turf.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">When and How to Overseed</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Timing is everything for overseeding. For cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass or fescue, overseed in early spring to allow seeds to germinate and establish roots before summer stress. For warm-season grasses like Bermuda or Zoysia, wait until late spring when soil temperatures are above 65°F.

                <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Your work after seeding determines success. The most important step is consistent, light watering—keep the seedbed moist but not soggy. You may need to water lightly 2-3 times a day for the first week or two until seeds sprout. Once new grass reaches about 3 inches, you can resume normal mowing. Avoid heavy traffic on seeded areas for at least a month.
